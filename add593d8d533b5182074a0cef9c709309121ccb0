      "message": "Yes, if we place the final line (the `jextract` invocation) inside some kind of conditional -- i.e. the same test as /this/ conditional, or something similar. In other words, if we don\u0027t update `PATH`, then we\u0027ll need to vary the invocation based on *something*, so that folks with it in their `PATH` can just call the script:\n\ne.g.\n```\nif \u003csome condition\u003e; then\n  $JEXTRACT_PATH/jextract -params ...\nelse\n  jextract -params ...\n```\n\n... or we just set up some `JEXTRACT` var that captures the location of the executable; which is just re-implementing `PATH`, IMHO!\n\nI think that having some setup or preamble that compartmentalises any complexity required then permits the invocation to be simpler - making scripts clearer to me, personally. Reasonable folks may disagree, of course, and I don\u0027t feel particularly strongly about this! :-)",
